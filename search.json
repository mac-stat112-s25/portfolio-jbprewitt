    "text": "Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture? - A visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable should capture the different mountains sorted into categories based on difficulty; it would help to include a key tied to the rating.\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable? - A visualization of the quantitative elevation variable should capture the variation between the various mountains as a direct comparison.This would have the peak name on the x axis and the elevation on the y axis.\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe?\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function?\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating?\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!?\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# Adds geom_bar() which adds the data as bars\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# adds labs(x = \"\",y = \"\") which labels both axes\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Adds fill = \"blue\" to geom_bar which changes the color of the bars\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# adds color = \"orange\" to geom_bar which makes the outline of the bars orange\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# adds theme_minimal() which changes the overall theme of the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it?\n\nthis adds an element to the plot\n\n\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?\n\ngeom for geometric\n\n\nWhat does labs() stand for?\n\nlabs means label\n\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\ncolor is the outline, fill is the body color\n\n\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\n\nWe observed the categories difficult, moderate, and easy\n\n\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\n\nsome vategories are more common than others, as seen by the distribution\n\n\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\nThe bar chart illustrated that of this list of potential hikes, over 25 of them are moderate difficulty, with the next most common category being easy with just over 10 of the hikes, and finally a bit under 10 of the hikes are difficult rating.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\n\nI want to have it start with easiest and move to harder hikes\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nThis chart is super hard to read and doesn’t help show which mountains have which elevation\n\n\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet? - between 5 and 7.5 hikes\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet? - at least 2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nThe center appears around 4,500\n\n\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nIt ranges from below 4,000 feet to 5,500 feet.\n\n\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\nIt is right skewed\n\n\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nIt doesn’t seem so\n\n\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nThis histogram of various peaks with hiking routes range in elevation from under 4,000 to just under 5,500. The data has a right skew and does not seem to have outliers.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# added geom_histogram() to the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# added color to the histogram which gave them a white outline\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# added fill to the histogram making the chart blue\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# added labs to the plot, labelling the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# switched the binwidth to 1000, which means it categorizes the data into 1000 value ranges\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# switched the binwidth to 5, which sorts the values into groupings of 5\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# changed bin width to 200\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry?\n\ngeom_histogram\n\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\ncolor is the outline, fill is the body color\n\n\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization?\n\nadding that allows for a clearer visual distinction between each bar\n\n\nWhat did binwidth do?\n\nthis changes the groupings of data chunks\n\n\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?\n\nBecause it is such a large data range, it is hard to get much information\n\n\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?\n\nThe categories are so small the data is no longer visually readable\n\n\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\n\nthis chart, in comparison to the histogram, better illustrates the distribution of elevation. It makes it harder to view the range and categories, but for many reasons this might be a superior plot. You can more easily see the typical elevation and the shape of the distribution.\n\n\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?\n\nIt depends on your goal to decide which is best for each situation\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why? - for better reading\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why? - it auto tabs and makes the spacing better so each distinct function remains separate\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +  \n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.",

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone? - this adds another element, creating a bivariate visualization.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number? - there is a variety of shapes to choose from \nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 10)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both. - color works, fill does not\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", fill = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\n\nThis is a linear relationship with a strong strength. It is a positive relationship, with potential outliers from Texas, which could indicate a higher proportion of support in 2020 than in 2016, which might be because of a dislike of democratic options or a like of Trump’s performance as president.\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing republican county support to median rent results is a weak to moderate strength negative relationship, meaning the higher rent the less support there was for the republican party. However, this plot has many outliers.\nComparing republican county supporter to median age results in a weak positive relationship, meaning that with higher age, there was generally higher support for the republican party. However, this plot has a lot of outliers.\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the variables on the X axis are categorical, it makes it very difficult to vizualize the data with a scatterplot.\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\nCompared to how each state historically voted, there were generally higher rates of republican support than normal. As the state became more red, so too did the deviance from their normal voting patterns.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\n# doesn't work!!\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot - The colors do not match the value names. You may not like the order the values are in. The labels aren't super clear for those unfamiliar with the data.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do? - It lets you assign colors to each value of the scale.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do? - it alters how transparent each value is\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1 (0 is invisible, 1 is full opacity)\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = .5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?! - it gives each category its own contained section\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible? - you can't tell good trends within each category, and it is overall hard to look at and read\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best? - Boxplots or density plots\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? - it is easier to view the overall relationship trend\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? - It is harder to understand the key values of the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n    facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play? - Historical allows for grouping of each category and provides context. Winner_20 shows the distribution of votes within each category. \nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\n\nPro: This really shows how much of the vote each party got in total\nCon: It doesn’t show the count (unlike in the side by side bar plot), thus making it harder to see that historically red states voted for the republican party at a much higher count than blue or purple states did\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?\n\nMy favorite will depend on what the goal of the data viz is; In this case I like the proportional bar plot because in my opinion it is the easiest to see variance.",

Most scores are closer to 900, with the data being right skewed.\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\n\nThese charts show a weak relationship between the variables in both cases, but they indicate that as spending increases scores actually decrease. This doesn’t sound like it would make sense, but I wonder if there is increased spending in areas where the scores are already lower which would make sense.\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation:\ncolour.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\n\nAs expenditure (expend) and salary increase together, SAT scores decrease.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x=fracCat))+\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more students in a state that take the SAT, the lower the average scores tend to be. This is likely because if it is rarer to take the test, students who can score higher are going to be the only ones taking it.\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graphic helps show that as expenditure increases, the score does increase, so long as you take into account the percent of students in the state whom take the test. Once you separate the percent of participation, spending is shown to increase scores. This shows why it is important to have accurate visualizations and take into account all potential variables.\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\n\nIn states with lower participation in the SAT, expenditure is also lower. These states have higher SAT scores because of self-selection.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "9.1.1 Preview\nYou’ll explore some R spatial viz tools below. In general, there are two important pieces to every map:\nPiece 1: A dataset\nThis dataset must include either:\n\nlocation coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or\nvariable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)\n\nPiece 2: A background map\nWe need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!\n\nCounty-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.\nWhere we grab this info can depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)\nWhere we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.\n\nIn short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:\n\nplay around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there\nunderstand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps\nhave fun\n\nYou can skip around as you wish and it’s totally fine if you don’t finish everything. Just come back at some point to play around.\nPart 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\n\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       59        18\n2       45       -93\n3       33      -117\n4       40       116\n5       40       106\n6       37      -122\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nWarning: package 'leaflet' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n# Just a plotting frame\nleaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have?\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\n# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\nWarning: package 'gplots' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gplots'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    lowess\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) |&gt;\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\n\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\n\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks |&gt;   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\nPart 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\n\nggplot(starbucks_mn, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\nWarning: package 'rnaturalearth' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\n# What does this code produce? - it creates a map of the world with a grid in the background\n\n# What geom are we using for the point map? - using geom_sf, which helps to visualize simple feature (sf) objects.\n\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nWarning: package 'mosaic' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\n\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.  The original behavior of these functions should not be affected by this.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'mosaic'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:Matrix':\n\n    mean\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    count, do, tally\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    cross\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    stat\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    binom.test, cor, cor.test, cov, fivenum, IQR, median, prop.test,\n    quantile, sd, t.test, var\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    max, mean, min, prod, range, sample, sum\n\n# Add a point for each Starbucks\n# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries\n# How does this change how we use geom_point?!\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nSummarize what you learned about Starbucks from this map.\n\nStarbucks is located mostly in the United States, Europe (specifically the United Kingdom and Ireland), and East Asia. It has higher concentrations in in places like Japan or the coastal regions of the United States.\nExercise 5: Zooming in on some countries\nInstead of world_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf') we could zoom in on…\n\nthe continent of Africa: ne_countries(continent = 'Africa', returnclass = 'sf')\n\na set of countries: ne_countries(country = c('france', 'united kingdom', 'germany'), returnclass = 'sf')\n\nboundaries within a country: ne_states(country = 'united YeYnonostates of america', returnclass = 'sf')\n\n\nOur goal here will be to map the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only Canada, Mexico, and the US, labeled as “CA”, “MX”, “US” in the starbucks data.\n\n\n# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.\nstarbucks_cma &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))\n\n\nA background map of state- and national-level boundaries in Canada, Mexico, and the US. This requires ne_states() in the rnaturalearth package where the countries are labeled ‘canada’, ‘mexico’, ‘united states of america’.\n\n\ncma_boundaries &lt;- ne_states(\n  country = c(\"canada\", \"mexico\", \"united states of america\"),\n  returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nPart b\nMake the map!\n\n# Just the boundaries\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add the points\n# And zoom in\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A state and county-level map\nLet’s get an even higher resolution map of Starbucks locations within the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with a background map at the county-level.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only the states of interest.\n\n\nstarbucks_midwest &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(State.Province %in% c(\"MN\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"WI\"))\n\n\nA background map of state- and county-level boundaries in these states.

For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first.

Typically, this is instead of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.\n\nAdd a figure caption in the top of the chunk.\nInclude your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.\nRender your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\nPlot which illustrates the temperature at 9 AM versus at 3 PM for 3 locations\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Accessibility\nLet’s now make a graphic more accessible.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a great resource on writing alt text for data viz. In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:\n\nWhat your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).\nA 1-sentence description of the most important takeaway.\nA link to your data source if it’s not already in the caption.\n\nAdd appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in fig-alt. Then render your qmd, and hover over the image in your rendered html file to check out the alt text.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nColor is another important accessibility consideration. Let’s check out the color accessibility of our density plot.\n\nRun the ggplot() code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.\nIn the Plots tab, click “Export” then “Save as image”. Save the image somewhere.\nNavigate to https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\n\nAbove the image of crayons (I think it’s crayons?), click “Choose file” and choose the plot file you just saved.\nClick the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.\nSummarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one’s ability to interpret the viz?\nPart c\nWe can change our color schemes! There are many color-blind friendly palettes in R. In the future, we’ll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the color scale line:\n# Change \"fill\" to \"color\" since we use color in the aes()\n# Change \"d\" (discrete) to \"c\" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Ethics\nLet’s scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of impact.\nPart a\nAt a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?\n\nPart b\nAgain, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we’ve learned are a great base or foundation, but aren’t the only approaches to data viz.\nPick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken:\n\nemphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context?\nimprove upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc?\n\n\nExample: W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963)\nDu Bois (“Doo Boys”) was a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1. He was also a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:\n\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\n\n\nExample: One person’s experience with long COVID\nNYT article\n\nExample: Decolonizing data viz\nblog post\n\nExample: Visualizing climate change through art\nFutures North with Prof John Kim & Mac students (by Prof Kim, Mac research students)\n\nExample: Personal data collection\nDear Data\n\nPart c\nFor a deeper treatment of similar topics, and more examples, read Data Feminism.\n\nExercise 4: Critique\nPractice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5.\nThink about the following questions:\n\nWhat story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?\nCan the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.\nCritique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?\n\n\nExercise 5: Design Details\nThis final exercise is just “food for thought”. It’s more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you’d like here.\nIn refining the details of our data viz, Visualize This and Storytelling with Data provide some of their guiding principles. But again, every context is different.\n\nPut yourself in a reader’s shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?\nShine a light on your data. Try to remove any “chart junk” that distracts from the data.\nVary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you’re telling.\nIt is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.\nBe thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.\n\nGetting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:2\n\nPosition\nLength\nAngle\nDirection\nShape (but only a very few different shapes)\nArea\nVolume\nShade\nColor. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)\n\nFinally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from Now You See It.\nPart a: Selectivity\nVisual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.\nImplication: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience’s attention.\nExample: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2004? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 33.\n\nPart b: Familiarity\nOur eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.\nImplication: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.\nExample: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 34.\n\nPart c: Revisit\nRevisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows? Go to https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/rose2.png for an image.",

This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\n\n# Define the dataset\n# Only store the results once you're confident that they're correct\nmn_wi &lt;- elections_small |&gt;\n  filter(state_name %in% c(\"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(dem_increase_20 = dem_pct_20-dem_pct_16) |&gt;\n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, dem_increase_20) |&gt;\n  arrange(dem_increase_20)\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your results\nhead(mn_wi)\n\n  state_name        county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16 dem_increase_20\n1  Minnesota     Stevens County      37.80      39.55           -1.75\n2  Wisconsin      Forest County      34.06      35.12           -1.06\n3  Wisconsin    Kewaunee County      32.87      33.73           -0.86\n4  Wisconsin       Clark County      30.37      31.19           -0.82\n5  Wisconsin       Adams County      36.63      37.40           -0.77\n6  Wisconsin Trempealeau County      40.86      41.57           -0.71\n\n\nPart c\nConstruct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\n# will complete if time at end\n\nExercise 7: summarize Demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n# What does this do? - return the median value of republican percent of vote in 2020\n\nelections_small |&gt;\n  summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n  median(repub_pct_20)\n1                68.29\n\n\n\n# What does this do? - create a new value median_repub which represents the median value of republican percent of vote in 2020\n\nelections_small |&gt;\n  summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n  median_repub\n1        68.29\n\n\n\n# What does this do? - create a new value median_repub which represents the median value of republican percent of vote in 2020, and a new value total_votes which is the sum of total_votes_20\n\nelections_small |&gt;\n  summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\n  median_repub total_votes\n1        68.29   157949293\n\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\nelections_small |&gt;\n  group_by(state_name)\n\n# A tibble: 3,109 × 7\n# Groups:   state_name [50]\n   state_name county_name  total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20 total_votes_16\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama    Autauga Cou…          27770         71.4      27.0           24661\n 2 Alabama    Baldwin Cou…         109679         76.2      22.4           94090\n 3 Alabama    Barbour Cou…          10518         53.4      45.8           10390\n 4 Alabama    Bibb County            9595         78.4      20.7            8748\n 5 Alabama    Blount Coun…          27588         89.6       9.57          25384\n 6 Alabama    Bullock Cou…           4613         24.8      74.7            4701\n 7 Alabama    Butler Coun…           9488         57.5      41.8            8685\n 8 Alabama    Calhoun Cou…          50983         68.8      29.8           47376\n 9 Alabama    Chambers Co…          15284         57.3      41.6           13778\n10 Alabama    Cherokee Co…          12301         86.0      13.2           10503\n# ℹ 3,099 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: dem_pct_16 &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\nelections_small |&gt;\n  class()\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nelections_small |&gt;\n  group_by(state_name) |&gt;\n  class()\n\n[1] \"grouped_df\" \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do? - this makes each sate one row and its values are the summarized values median_repub and total_votes\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?) - it would just give the total values for the entire dataset\n\nelections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name) |&gt;\n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n   state_name           median_repub total_votes\n   &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama                      70.6     2323304\n 2 Arizona                      57.9     3387326\n 3 Arkansas                     72.1     1219069\n 4 California                   44.8    17495906\n 5 Colorado                     56.2     3256953\n 6 Connecticut                  41.0     1824280\n 7 Delaware                     47.1      504010\n 8 District of Columbia          5.4      344356\n 9 Florida                      64.6    11067456\n10 Georgia                      68       4997716\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\n\n\nExercise 9: DIY\nLet’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time.\n\nPart a\nNOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise. If you get really stuck, move on to Part b which is the same overall question, but with hints.\n\n# Sort the *states* from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each *state*?\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n\nPart b\n\n# Sort the states from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n# HINT: Calculate the total number of votes in each state, then sort\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each state?\n# HINT: First calculate the number of Dem and Repub votes in each *county*\n# Then group and summarize these by state\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n# HINT: Start with the results from the previous chunk, and then keep only some rows\n\nExercise 10: Practice on New Data\nRecall the World Cup football/soccer data from TidyTuesday:\n\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nYou can find a codebook here. Use (some of) our 6 verbs (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) and data viz to address the following prompts.\n\n# In what years did Brazil win the World Cup?\n\n\n# What were the 6 World Cups with the highest attendance?\n\n\n# Construct a univariate plot of goals_scored (no wrangling necessary)\n# This provides a visual summary of how the number of goals_scored varies from World Cup to World Cup\n\n\n# Let's follow up the plot with some more precise numerical summaries\n# Calculate the min, median, and max number of goals_scored across all World Cups\n# NOTE: Visually compare these numerical summaries to what you observed in the plot\n\n\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the number of goals_scored in the World Cup has changed over the years\n# No wrangling necessary\n\n\n# Our above summaries might be a bit misleading.\n# The number of games played at the World Cup varies.\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the typical number of goals per game has changed over the years",

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances.\n\nThe data could be valuable even if it is missing values, and by deleting it all we could miss important information\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\n\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(-island) |&gt;\n  select(-year)\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 6\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA          NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181        3625 female\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195        4675 male  \n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193        3475 &lt;NA&gt;  \n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190        4250 &lt;NA&gt;  \n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, ends_with(\"mm\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 4\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193\n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, contains(\"bill\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n 4 Adelie            NA            NA  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1\n10 Adelie            42            20.2\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, contains(\"length\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3               195\n 4 Adelie            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1               193\n10 Adelie            42                 190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2025-03-03\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates. Let’s learn about some of the most common functions by applying them to today. For each, make a comment on what the function does\n\nyear(today) # returns the year as of todays date... if today was in 2024, it would print 2024\n\n[1] 2025\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\nmonth(today) # this prints out the number of the month of the 12 (feb is 2 of 12)\n\n[1] 3\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE) # this prints out the month but with the label so it says feb\n\n[1] Mar\n12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec\n\n\n\n# What does this number mean?\nweek(today) # this is the week of 52 of the year on today\n\n[1] 9\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\nmday(today) # this produces the day of the month\n\n[1] 3\n\nyday(today)  # this is the day of the year - This is often called the \"Julian day\"\n\n[1] 62\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\nwday(today) # this produces the week day, in a number of the 7 days of the week\n\n[1] 2\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE) # this produces the week day with the name\n\n[1] Mon\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\n\n\n# What do the results of these 2 lines tell us? - True if it matches today, false if not\ntoday &gt;= ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoday &lt; ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] FALSE",

We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\nBirthdays |&gt; \n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  summarize(total = sum(day))\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 2\n   state  total\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 AK    114936\n 2 AL    115119\n 3 AR    115058\n 4 AZ    115057\n 5 CA    115518\n 6 CO    114905\n 7 CT    115117\n 8 DC    115087\n 9 DE    114967\n10 FL    114967\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  summarize(total = sum(births))\n\n     total\n1 70486538\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\nBirthdays |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  summarize(total = sum(births)) |&gt;\n  arrange(total)\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 2\n   state  total\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 VT    147886\n 2 WY    154019\n 3 AK    185385\n 4 DE    188705\n 5 SD    235734\n 6 ND    238696\n 7 NV    241470\n 8 MT    253884\n 9 NH    264984\n10 RI    265038\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon. NOTE: Name the column with total births so that it’s easier to wrangle and plot.\n\n# daily_births &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n#   mutatue() \n\n# wday(today, label = TRUE)\n\nUsing this data, construct a plot of births over time, indicating the day of week.\nExercise 7: Wrangle & Plot\nFor each prompt below, you can decide whether you want to: (1) wrangle and store data, then plot; or (2) wrangle data and pipe directly into ggplot. For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\nExercise 8: More Practice\nPart a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births.",

It might help to think about what you’d need to complete the plotting frame:\nggplot(___, aes(y = ___, x = ___, color = ___))\ny - reaction time\nx - days of sleep restriction\ncolor - subject\nNeed to make table longer to combine days\nPart c\nHow can you obtain the dataset you sketched in part b?\n\njust using sleep_wide\n\npivot_longer() !!! This one !!!\npivot_wider()\nExercise 2: Pivot longer\nTo plot reaction time by day for each subject, we need to reshape the data into a long format where each row represents a subject/day combination. Specifically, we want a dataset with 3 columns and a first few rows that look something like this:\n\n\nSubject\nday\nreaction_time\n\n\n\n308\n0\n249.56\n\n\n308\n1\n258.70\n\n\n308\n2\n250.80\n\n\n\nPart a\nUse pivot_longer() to create the long-format dataset above. Show the first 3 lines (head(3)), which should be similar to those above. Follow-up: Thinking forward to plotting reaction time vs day for each subject, what would you like to fix / change about this dataset?\n\n# For cols, try 2 appproaches: using - and starts_with\n# ___ |&gt; \n#   pivot_longer(cols = ___, names_to = \"___\", values_to = \"___\")\n\nPart b\nRun this chunk:\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject day   reaction_time\n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     308 0              250.\n2     308 1              259.\n3     308 2              251.\n4     308 3              321.\n5     308 4              357.\n6     308 5              415.\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nBesides putting each argument on a different line for readability and storing the results, what changed in the code?\n\nIt became longer, switching from separate days to just one day column and one reaction time variable for each subject\n\n\nHow did this impact how the values are recorded in the day column?\n\nThey are spread out 0-N\n\n\nPart c\nUsing sleep_long, construct a line plot of reaction time vs day for each subject. This will look goofy no matter what you do. Why? HINT: look back at head(sleep_long). What class or type of variables are Subject and day? What do we want them to be?\n\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(x=day, y = reaction_time, color = Subject)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Reaction Time with Sleep Deprivation\",\n       x = \"Days of Sleep Restriction\",\n       y = \"Reaction Time (ms)\",\n       Color = \"Subject\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Changing variable classes & plotting\nLet’s finalize sleep_long by mutating the Subject variable to be a factor (categorical) and the day variable to be numeric (quantitative). Take note of the mutate() code! You’ll use this type of code a lot.\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))\n\n# Check it out\n# Same data, different class\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject   day reaction_time\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308         0          250.\n2 308         1          259.\n3 308         2          251.\n4 308         3          321.\n5 308         4          357.\n6 308         5          415.\n\n\nPart a\nNow make some plots.\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on the same frame\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(x=day, y = reaction_time, color = Subject)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Reaction Time with Sleep Deprivation\",\n       x = \"Days of Sleep Restriction\",\n       y = \"Reaction Time (ms)\",\n       Color = \"Subject\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on separate frames (one per subject)\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(x=day, y = reaction_time, color = Subject)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Reaction Time with Sleep Deprivation\",\n       x = \"Days of Sleep Restriction\",\n       y = \"Reaction Time (ms)\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize what you learned from the plots. For example:\n\nWhat’s the general relationship between reaction time and sleep?\n\nGenerally everyone had longer reaction times as the days of sleep restriction went on\n\n\nIs this the same for everybody? What differs?\n\nNot everyone had these reactions; some people had a spike down in reaction time before resuming, and some like 335 had a lesser reaction time over time.\n\n\nExercise 4: Pivot wider\nMake the data wide again, with each day becoming its own column.\nPart a\nAdjust the code below. What don’t you like about the column labels?\n\nsleep_long |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = day, values_from = reaction_time) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  Subject   `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`   `7`   `8`   `9`\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308      250.  259.  251.  321.  357.  415.  382.  290.  431.  466.\n2 309      223.  205.  203.  205.  208.  216.  214.  218.  224.  237.\n3 310      199.  194.  234.  233.  229.  220.  235.  256.  261.  248.\n4 330      322.  300.  284.  285.  286.  298.  280.  318.  305.  354.\n5 331      288.  285   302.  320.  316.  293.  290.  335.  294.  372.\n6 332      235.  243.  273.  310.  317.  310   454.  347.  330.  254.\n\n\nPart b\nUsing your intuition, adjust your code from part a to name the reaction time columns “day_0”, “day_1”, etc.\n\nsleep_long |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = day, values_from = reaction_time, names_prefix = \"day_\") |&gt;\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  Subject day_0 day_1 day_2 day_3 day_4 day_5 day_6 day_7 day_8 day_9\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308      250.  259.  251.  321.  357.  415.  382.  290.  431.  466.\n2 309      223.  205.  203.  205.  208.  216.  214.  218.  224.  237.\n3 310      199.  194.  234.  233.  229.  220.  235.  256.  261.  248.\n4 330      322.  300.  284.  285.  286.  298.  280.  318.  305.  354.\n5 331      288.  285   302.  320.  316.  293.  290.  335.  294.  372.\n6 332      235.  243.  273.  310.  317.  310   454.  347.  330.  254.\n\n\nExercise 5: Practice with Billboard charts\nLoad data on songs that hit the billboard charts around the year 2000. Included for each song is the artist name, track name, the date it hit the charts (date.enter), and wk-related variables that indicate rankings in each subsequent week on the charts:\n\n# Load data\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndata(\"billboard\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(billboard)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 79\n  artist      track date.entered   wk1   wk2   wk3   wk4   wk5   wk6   wk7   wk8\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2 Pac       Baby… 2000-02-26      87    82    72    77    87    94    99    NA\n2 2Ge+her     The … 2000-09-02      91    87    92    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n3 3 Doors Do… Kryp… 2000-04-08      81    70    68    67    66    57    54    53\n4 3 Doors Do… Loser 2000-10-21      76    76    72    69    67    65    55    59\n5 504 Boyz    Wobb… 2000-04-15      57    34    25    17    17    31    36    49\n6 98^0        Give… 2000-08-19      51    39    34    26    26    19     2     2\n# ℹ 68 more variables: wk9 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk10 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk11 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk12 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk13 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk14 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk15 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk16 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk17 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk18 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk19 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk20 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk21 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk22 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk23 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk24 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk25 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk26 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk27 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk28 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk29 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk30 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk31 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk32 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk33 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk34 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk35 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk36 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk37 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk38 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk39 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk40 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk41 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk42 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk43 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk44 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk45 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk46 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk47 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk48 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nIn using this data, you’ll need to determine if and when the data needs to be reshaped for the task at hand.\nPart a\nConstruct and summarize a plot of how a song’s Billboard ranking its 2nd week on the chart (y-axis) is related to its ranking the 1st week on the charts (x-axis). Add a reference line geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1). Songs above this line improved their rankings from the 1st to 2nd week.\n\nggplot(billboard, aes(x=wk1, y = wk2)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)\n\nWarning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nUse your wrangling tools to identify which songs are those above the line in Part a, i.e. with rankings that went up from week 1 to week 2.\nPart c\nDefine a new dataset, nov_1999, which:\n\nonly includes data on songs that entered the Billboard charts on November 6, 1999\nkeeps all variables except track and date.entered. HINT: How can you avoid writing out all the variable names you want to keep?\n\n\n# Define nov_1999\n\n\n# Confirm that nov_1999 has 2 rows (songs) and 77 columns\n\nPart d\nCreate and discuss a visualization of the rankings (y-axis) over time (x-axis) for the 2 songs in nov_1999. There are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHints:\n\nShould you first pivot wider or longer?\nOnce you pivot, the week number is turned into a character variable. How can you change it to a number?\nExercise 6: Practice with the Daily Show\nThe data associated with this article is available in the fivethirtyeight package, and is loaded into daily below. It includes a list of every guest to ever appear on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show, a “late-night talk and satirical news” program (per Wikipedia). Check out the dataset and note that when multiple people appeared together, each person receives their own line:\n\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\n\nWarning: package 'fivethirtyeight' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nSome larger datasets need to be installed separately, like senators and\nhouse_district_forecast. To install these, we recommend you install the\nfivethirtyeightdata package by running:\ninstall.packages('fivethirtyeightdata', repos =\n'https://fivethirtyeightdata.github.io/drat/', type = 'source')\n\ndata(\"daily_show_guests\")\ndaily &lt;- daily_show_guests\n\nIn analyzing this data, you’ll need to determine if and when the data needs to be reshaped.\nPart a\nIdentify the 15 guests that appeared the most. (This isn’t a very diverse guest list!)\nPart b\nCHALLENGE: Create the following data set containing 19 columns:\n\nThe first column should have the 15 guests with the highest number of total appearances on the show, listed in descending order of number of appearances.\n17 columns should show the number of appearances of the corresponding guest in each year from 1999 to 2015 (one per column).\nAnother column should show the total number of appearances for the corresponding guest over the entire duration of the show.\n\nThere are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHINTS: There are lots of ways to do this. You don’t necessarily need all of these hints.\n\nFirst obtain the number of times a guest appears each year.\nAdd a new column which includes the total number of times a guest appears across all years.\nPivot (longer or wider?). When you do, use values_fill = 0 to replace NA values with 0.\nArrange, then and keep the top 15.\nPart c\nLet’s recreate the first figure from the article. This groups all guests into 3 broader occupational categories. However, our current data has 18 categories:\n\ndaily |&gt; \n  count(group)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n   group              n\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Academic         103\n 2 Acting           930\n 3 Advocacy          24\n 4 Athletics         52\n 5 Business          25\n 6 Clergy             8\n 7 Comedy           150\n 8 Consultant        18\n 9 Government        40\n10 Media            751\n11 Military          16\n12 Misc              45\n13 Musician         123\n14 Political Aide    36\n15 Politician       308\n16 Science           28\n17 media              5\n18 &lt;NA&gt;              31\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that includes a new variable, broad_group, that buckets these 18 categories into the 3 bigger ones used in the article. And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first.",

You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join.\n\n# eval = FALSE: don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info. Did this work? Try and figure out the culprit by examining the output.\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(class, grade)`\n\n\n  student    class grade enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101     B         NA\n2       Y BIOL 101     S         NA\n3       Z POLI 101     C         NA\n4       Z COMP 101     A         NA\n\n\nPart d\nThe issue here is that our datasets have 2 column names in common: class and grade. BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact |&gt; \n  anti_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2. We want contact info for people who HAVE voted\nvoters |&gt; \n  left_join(contact, join_by(id == name))\n\n  id times_voted  address age\n1  A           2   summit  24\n2  D           4 fairview  38\n3  E          17     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n4  F           6     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  G          20     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n\n# 3. We want any data available on each person\nvoters |&gt; \n  full_join(contact, join_by(id == name))\n\n  id times_voted  address age\n1  A           2   summit  24\n2  D           4 fairview  38\n3  E          17     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n4  F           6     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  G          20     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n6  B          NA    grand  89\n7  C          NA snelling  43\n\n# 4. When possible, we want to add contact info to the voting roster\nvoters |&gt; \n  left_join(contact, join_by(id == name))\n\n  id times_voted  address age\n1  A           2   summit  24\n2  D           4 fairview  38\n3  E          17     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n4  F           6     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  G          20     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n\n\nExercise 3: Bigger datasets\nLet’s apply these ideas to some bigger datasets. In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\ndim(grades)\n\n[1] 5844    3\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\ndim(courses)\n\n[1] 1718    6\n\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\n# courses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt; \n#   ___(sessionID) |&gt; \n#   ___(enroll = sum(___))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\n# dim(courses_combined)\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart c\nBut how big are classes from the student perspective? To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart d\nThe median class size varies from student to student. To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\n\n# ggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = ___)) + \n#   geom___()\n\nExercise 5: Narrowing in on classes\nPart a\nShow data on the students that enrolled in session1986. THINK FIRST: Which of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nPart b\nBelow is a dataset with all courses in department E:\n\ndept_E &lt;- courses |&gt; \n  filter(dept == \"E\")\n\nWhat students enrolled in classes in department E? (We just want info on the students, not the classes.)\nExercise 6: All the wrangling\nUse all of your wrangling skills to answer the following prompts! THINK FIRST:\n\nThink about what tables you might need to join (if any). Identify the corresponding variables to match.\nYou’ll need an extra table to convert grades to grade point averages:\n\n\ngpa_conversion &lt;- tibble(\n  grade = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"NC\", \"AU\", \"S\"), \n  gp = c(4.3, 4, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.7, 2.3, 2, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 0.7, 0, NA, NA)\n)\n\ngpa_conversion\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   grade    gp\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A+      4.3\n 2 A       4  \n 3 A-      3.7\n 4 B+      3.3\n 5 B       3  \n 6 B-      2.7\n 7 C+      2.3\n 8 C       2  \n 9 C-      1.7\n10 D+      1.3\n11 D       1  \n12 D-      0.7\n13 NC      0  \n14 AU     NA  \n15 S      NA  \n\n\nPart a\nHow many total student enrollments are there in each department? Order from high to low.\nPart b\nWhat’s the grade-point average (GPA) for each student?\nPart c\nWhat’s the median GPA across all students?\nPart d\nWhat fraction of grades are below B+?\nPart e\nWhat’s the grade-point average for each instructor? Order from low to high.\nPart f\nCHALLENGE: Estimate the grade-point average for each department, and sort from low to high. NOTE: Don’t include cross-listed courses. Students in cross-listed courses could be enrolled under either department, and we do not know which department to assign the grade to. HINT: You’ll need to do multiple joins.",
