## Exercises (required)

### The story {.unnumbered}

Though far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state's education system.
The `education` dataset contains various education variables for each state:

```{r}

##load tidyverse

library(tidyverse)

# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```

A codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:

### Exercise 1: SAT scores {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Construct a plot of how the average `sat` scores vary from state to state.
(Just use 1 variable -- `sat` not `State`!)

```{r}

ggplot(education, aes(x=sat))+
  geom_histogram()
```

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Summarize your observations from the plot.
Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape.
(Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)

-   Based on this plot there is an approx.
    range of scores 825 to 1250.
    Most scores are closer to 900, with the data being right skewed.

### Exercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries {.unnumbered}

The first question we'd like to answer is: Can the variability in `sat` scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (`expend`) and typical teacher `salary`?

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

What are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending?
Is there anything that surprises you?

-   These charts show a weak relationship between the variables in both cases, but they indicate that as spending increases scores actually decrease.
    This doesn't sound like it would make sense, but I wonder if there is increased spending in areas where the scores are already lower which would make sense.

### Exercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending *and* Teacher Salaries {.unnumbered}

Construct *one* visualization of the relationship of `sat` with `salary` *and* `expend`.
HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable.
Try out a few things!

```{r}

ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Exercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale {.unnumbered}

It can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables.
Another option is to *discretize* a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into *categories*.

Construct the plot below.
Check out the code and think about what's happening here.
What happens if you change "2" to "3"?

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

Describe the trivariate relationship between `sat`, `salary`, and `expend`.

-   As expenditure (expend) and salary increase together, SAT scores decrease.

### Exercise 5: Finally an Explanation {.unnumbered}

It's strange that SAT scores *seem* to decrease with spending.
But we're leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state's students that actually take the SAT.
The `fracCat` variable indicates this fraction: `low` (under 15% take the SAT), `medium` (15-45% take the SAT), and `high` (at least 45% take the SAT).

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Build a univariate viz of `fracCat` to better understand how many states fall into each category.

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x=fracCat))+
  geom_bar()
```

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Build 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between `sat` and `fracCat`.
What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?

```{r}

ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)

```

-   The more students in a state that take the SAT, the lower the average scores tend to be.
    This is likely because if it is rarer to take the test, students who can score higher are going to be the only ones taking it.

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

Make a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of `sat` with `expend` AND `fracCat`.
Highlight the differences in `fracCat` groups through color AND unique trend lines.
What story does your graphic tell?\
Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?

```{r}

ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   This graphic helps show that as expenditure increases, the score does increase, so long as you take into account the percent of students in the state whom take the test.
    Once you separate the percent of participation, spending is shown to increase scores.
    This shows why it is important to have accurate visualizations and take into account all potential variables.

#### Part d {.unnumbered}

Putting all of this together, explain this example of **Simpsonâ€™s Paradox**.
That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the *opposite* is true?

-   In states with lower participation in the SAT, expenditure is also lower.
    These states have higher SAT scores because of self-selection.
